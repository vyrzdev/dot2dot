This ones gonna be quite simple.

For services like Etsy we can format a lot of data into a standard description
For square we can drop almost all of the detailed product data
For WooCommerce however... we need to be able to create custom fields through an API Call...

Leaving that complication aside for now...

We will make API changes when a product is edited...
As well as nightly consistency checks.

These consistency checks could become costly... Ignore that for now.
