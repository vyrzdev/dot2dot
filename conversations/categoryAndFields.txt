We have a couple options...

We could have a completely seperate resource called fields, and when you add a field, you can then select it from the category...
Or do we instead have a endpoint like: /category/fields/(create, edit, view)/targetID
No because then which target is that... the category or the field?
I suggest an alternative /category/fields/{targetCatID}/(create, edit, view)/{targetFieldID}


Perfect!

Fields will be unique to each category.
